## Introduction

The goal of this project is to calculate the mathematical risk process model based on its single trajectory. This model describes the capital of insurance company. 
After obtaining this model, simulations will be conducted for different time horizons, to estimate the probability of ruin. This probability indicates the chances of 
the insurance company reaching bankruptcy. 

All the necessary theory used in the process is described in the notebook file.

## Technologies

* Software to open a Jupyter notebook file
* Python 3.9.2  
  * Pandas 1.2.3
  * Statsmodels 0.12.2
  * Numpy 1.20.1
  * Scipy 1.6.1
  * Matplotlib 3.3.4
  
## Setup
In order to run this project  a software to open the Jupyter notebook file is necessary. The file can be read without running the code, all result are shown and described.
When running the code, two .csv files included in repository are necessary. All cells should be run in order. For some simulations, only the result was included in the table in
order to avoid long computation time, should someone choose to run the code.
